## Requirements

For this assignment you are going to chose from 3 different client themes.  Each client theme has similar requirements that you must meet using the Twitter Bootstrap framework.  You are required to style this theme to match the description of the client.

PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY PROJECT 1 OR PROJECT 2 - THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE CREATED FROM SCRATCH

Example:  If you pick Cozy Corner, you are required to find images that would represent a book store.  

The 3 clients are as follows:

1. Cozy Corner - Local bookstore

2. Calm Mind - Spa and Yoga Classes

3. Road Warriors - Bicycle sales shop 

After you have picked a theme, follow the checklist of requirements in the Rubric.  Each of the rubric requirements represent a piece of the total points attainable on an assignment.  If you complete each task on the rubric, you will get an A on the assignment.  

Design Requirements

Pick out a website that you admire and use it as your layout guide.  You don't have to match every little nuance, but the final layout should look very close to your guide.

Content Requirements

You MUST use theme appropriate headings and images everything else can be lorum ipsum.

Example:  If I picked Road Warriors as my theme then all of my header titles would be bike shop themed.  The rest of content, as described in the rubric, can be lorum ipsum.

Here are a few of my favorite ipsum sites to help you fill content:
